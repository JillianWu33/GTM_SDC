# GTM/SDC - Decoder
In this document, you will learn how to install and use the decoder developed by NTHU GTM team. This decoder is a cross-platform software supporting MacOS, Linux and Windows. You can find more details in [Installation](##Installation) section. The purpose of this software is to decode those binary data recorded by GTM on Formosat-8B to human-readable data according to internal GTM definition. Please go [Utility](##Utility) section to understand more.

## Installation

To speed up the decoding process, we use C to handle heavy memory calculation. Moreover, we import Qt5 libary in Python to build up a morden user interface (UI) to prevent user have to type in lots of trivial commands to trigger decoder in terminal, such as Telemetry and Telecommand (TM/TC) or Science Data (SD), raw or pipeline SD, ..., etc. Therefore, we recommend you to install [GCC](###GCC) and [Python](###Python) in your device to execute this software
